# block-stacking
A game written in C++ to get some practice with C++, writing games, and learn the Allegro library.

This game is played by moving the ground to the left and right using the arrow keys. As blocks land on the ground they become part of the ground and move back and forth with the arrow keys. After a stack of blocks reaches a certain height the level ends and all the blocks are erased and blocks now fall faster then before. After 10 levels are played the game ends.
